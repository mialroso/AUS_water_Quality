For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualisations. Here are the specific requirements:

Your visualisation must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:

A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualisation (must be approved)

Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

Your final visualisation should ideally include at least three views.
